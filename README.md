PROGRAMMING FOUNDATION CURRICULUM
@ IMPERFECTION:
   Nature has provided us some basic 
   resources (such as water bodies,
   land that contain metal ores  etc) ,
   and structures like our human 
   legs to move about, that our lives
   unarguably rely on. That's 
   largely cool enough ! Then there
   comes some limitations : trek a 5km
   road to realize the obvious.
   This calls for a better means of doing
things (long distance travel in our
case). This is a Problem !
Vehicles, for example , were made to 
reduce the problem of likelihood of
going fatigue in long distance journey.
@ GENERAL SYSTEM MODEL
  When we think deeply we can realize 
  work has to be done for a "meaningful"
  thing to happen. 
      NORMAL ===>WORK===> BETTER 
  Let's observe onece again ! Cars , for 
  instance, are cool to use . But they
  have their cost overheads : pollution
  sudden brake failure etc 
  This is a man-made problem. 
  This calls ,once again,for even 
  better ways of traveling . EFFICIENCY
  is what we need. This is why you see
  different companies invest in advance
  technologies like "greener oils" ,
  electric cars etc . 
       NORMAL====>WORK===>BETTER
                   ||
             COST OVERHEAD
                   ||
               EFFICIENCY

   
@ PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS 
  (HINTING IN TOPICS)
Anytime we are hit by a problem
(say you want to cook rice) we tend to 
BREAK-IT-DOWN into smaller pieces to
 discover some PATTERNS or FACTS we can 
take advantage of to solve it quickly.
Most times facts we get may be useful
yet some are more relevant to the pro
blem at hand . So we ABSTRACT(ignore)
 irrelevant
details so as not to burden ourselves
too much. Then we start thinking of the 
series of precise steps to take to solve
the problem. This is called an 
ALGORITHM . Moreover you are likely going 
to have a rethink to ensure your plans 
are good enough (especially when they 
are costly to put into action).
Of course , you will IMPLEMENT or
execute your plans physically . This 
usually involves using some available 
resources like human labour , a machine
chemical materials etc . You may even go 
as far as developing a "thing" , depending
on how acute the situation is.

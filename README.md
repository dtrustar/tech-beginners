PROGRAMMING FOUNDATION CURRICULUM
@ IMPERFECTION:
   Nature has provided some basic 
   resources (such as water bodies,
   land that contain metal ores  etc) ,
   and structures like our human 
   legs to move about, that our lives
   unarguably rely on. That's 
   largely cool enough ! Then there
   comes some limitations : trek a 5km
   road to realize the obvious.
   This calls for a better means of doing
things (long distance travel in our
case). This is a Problem !
